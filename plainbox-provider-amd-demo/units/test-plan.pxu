unit: test plan
_description:
 This test plan is intended for use inside Canonical's test labs. The tests
 contained in this list are the same as those contained in the
 client-selftest test plan that OEMs may use. The difference here is that
 some of these tests depend on a specific network environment and may not run
 properly in your test environment. To avoid false failures, please use the
 client-selftest test plan instead.
